### Summary
The weather in June is only approximately 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than in December, which means Oahu is ideal for a year-round surf shop! The precipitation data shows that there are many sunny days throughout the year. With December minimum temperatures reaching just 53 degrees Fahrenheit and June maximum temperatures reaching 85 degrees Fahrenheit, surfers can expect many warm, balmy days filled with sun, sand, and ice cream!
